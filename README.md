Create a very basic webpage with Python and SQLite, build a simple API endpoint for it, and then consume that API through the command line. Avoid frameworks like Django and Flask to keep things as fundamental as possible.

# Below is the Gemini Prompt that I used
I want to learn how to create a very basic webpage with python and sqllite, preferraly no django or flask or any other framework. Then for this web page, i want to build one api endpoint that interacts with the db and send the data as response. only get request for now. then i want to consume my api through cli. no hosting of webpage is required. all things to be done in local computer. guide me step by step. keep things very basic as this is only to undestand the concept and use of api.
